# HTTP 1.1 From Scratch

## Goal

To implement a HTTP 1.1 server completely from scratch including implementing a
a TCP socket from scratch.

## Purpose

To get more familiar with the inner workings of HTTP, TCP, and REST.

## Implementation Plan

### Simple Implementation

Initially, I want to create a working HTTP 1.1 server that uses some pre-built
components. This implementation will not be very in depth, but will serve to
give me me a higher level understanding of TCP, HTTP, and how things are
generally structured.

### Full Implementation

After completing a working, higher-level implementation, I will take each
component and rebuild it from scratch. This will provide me with a lower level
understanding of how things like TCP and HTTP works.

## Components to Implement

### TCP

I'll need to build a TCP server to listen for and handle connections to the HTTP
server.
